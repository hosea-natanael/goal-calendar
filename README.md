A goal calendar in web app format made with React JS, React Router, TailwindCSS and React Calendar. This project goal is to show my skill in reactivity on a common web app flow.

The project is divided in two folders `fe` and `server`. Please mainly refer to the `fe` folder as the `server` folder was more of an **ad-hoc** solution for an API back end.

# Demo
You can check out the application running live on a VPS from this link [https://goal-calendar.work.gd](https://goal-calendar.work.gd).

# Installation and Run
Setting up the front end by installing dependecies and copying the environment file.
```bash
cd ./fe

# install dependencies
npm install

# copying `.env.example` file to `.env`
cp .env.example .env

# run in development
npm run dev
```

Setting up the back end by just installing dependecies.
```bash
# open a new terminal or session
cd ./server

# install dependencies
npm install

# run in development
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) in your browser and register an account to login and finally use the app.
