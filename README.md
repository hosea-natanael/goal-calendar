A goal calendar in web app format made with React JS, React Router, TailwindCSS and React Calendar. This project goal is to show my skill in reactivity on a common web app flow.

The project is divided in two folders `fe` and `server`. Please mainly refer to the `fe` folder as the `server` folder was more of an ad-hoc solution for an API back end.

# Getting Started
```bash
#setting up front end
cd ./fe

npm install

npm dev

#setting up API back end
# open a new terminal or session
cd ./server

npm install

npm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](htttp://localhost:3001) in your browser and register an account to login and finally use the app.
